To add new objectives follow these steps:

1. create a new event in ObjectiveEvents
2. create a new objective script that inherits from Objective class. Example: Obj_SendMail.cs
3. place the objective logic there and make sure to subscribe and unsubscribe to Complete event with the events you created
4. add a new scriptable object (Objective -> the class you created)
5. add the scriptable object to the ObjectiveManager list
